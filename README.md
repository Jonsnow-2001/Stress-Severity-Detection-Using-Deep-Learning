# Stress-Severity-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
->I’m thrilled to share my first-ever Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning project, where I explored how AI can quantify human stress from physiological signals like PPG (Photoplethysmography). This marks the beginning of my journey into AI, deep neural architectures, and multimodal fusion!
